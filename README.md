# Machine-lerning-and-Neural-Network

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to analyze high-dimensional MNIST data. We implement several techniques, including ensemble methods and neural networks, alongside methodologies for hyperparameter tuning and dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE.

## Files
project6_V2.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing the code, models, and analysis.
Key Components
Data Loading: Load the MNIST dataset.
Data Normalization: Normalize the pixel values for better model performance.
Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Building:
Ensemble of various machine learning models.
Design and training of a neural network model.
Performance Evaluation:
Generate classification reports to evaluate model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Techniques to optimize model parameters.
Dimensionality Reduction:
Use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE to visualize MNIST data in 2D space.

## Requirements
sklearn
matplotlib
keras (for Neural Network)
